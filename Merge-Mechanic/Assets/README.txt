MECHANIC FOR MESH GAMES

MERGE OPERATION PROCESS IS HAPPENING IN THE "GAMEMANAGER"
IF YOU TRY TO MAKE MERGE OPERATION IN BALL SCRIPTS, YOU WILL FAIL
IN BALLCONTROLLER.CS WE JUST DISABLE OTHER BALLS COLLIDE BOOLEAN
THAT WAY WE CALL GAMEMANAGER.CREATENEWBALL() FOR ONCE
WE INSTANTIATE NEW BALLS
THIS DEPENDS ON YOUR GAME TYPE
BUT I SUGGEST USE OBJECT POOL SYSTEM

PARTICLE EFFECT CALLED "CREATEBALL" IN THE GAME SCENE IS NEVER DESTROYED IN ANY OPERATION
WHEN EFFECT ENDS, EFFECT GOES OFF
IF YOU WANT TO USE THE EFFECT AGAIN JUST REPLACE IT AND PLAY
THAT WAY IS PERFORMANCE SAVER
